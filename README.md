# Ember Shopping Cart
#### _Ember Practice, Week 4 of Epicodus Javascript, 4.6.2016_

### By _**Mary Warrington and Mike Schennum**_

This project is built in Ember and is an ecommerce site. From the admin panel, an admin can manage inventory (add, delete, etc.). From the user side, users can shop and add items to their shopping cart. The cart is not fully functional, nor secure, and does not allow for an actual checkout to occur.
